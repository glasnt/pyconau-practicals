# Lightning talks


With a conference schedule that's chosen months ahead of time, having a co-ordinated off-the-cuff presentation format is exceedingly useful for attendees. 

These lightning talks are five-minute talks, selected daily, presented to the full audience after the afternoon invited speaker, and can be summed up as... eclectic.
