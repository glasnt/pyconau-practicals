# Thanks

No conference can be run by any one person. There are many thanks for the efforts that made PyCon AU possible. 

The full list of thanks for [2018](https://2018.pycon-au.org/news/pyconau-2018-over/) and [2019](https://2019.pycon-au.org/news/pycon-au-over/) include an item of "everyone else that weâ€™ve missed", because it's indeed possible to miss someone, and no-one who helped shouldn't be thanked. 

We also like to make small tokens for particular people of note. 

## Speaker gifts - mugs

Speakers at PyCon AU get a coffee mug - a white ceramic cup with iconography printed on it. In previous years the printing would be just a generic "Conference Name -- Year", but we added to the incremental embelishments to create a full wrap-around mug with our mascot. 

These mugs stand pride of place on many a cabinet, and make for a gift where you don't have to worry about attendee sizing or drink preference. Ensuring that your speakers know in advance - however - that they need to transport crockery with them would be useful. 

## Speaker extras - pins

We were fortunate enough to get a set of enamel pins made, which we gave our to speakers, volunteers, and people who went above and beyond to help with the conference. These small 1inch pins are just of the python logo with the Australian green and gold colouring. But of note: we ensured these pins were made from a nickel-free alloy -- nickel allergies are not uncommon, and enamel pins are often made with alloys of majority nickel. If you are commissioning your own, see what alloys are available.
