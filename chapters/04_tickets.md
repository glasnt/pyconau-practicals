# Tickets

_A conference needs three things: a venue, speakers, and **attendees**._

Aside from travel and accomodation to stay in a conference location, the biggest
barrier to entry, but also the biggest fundraising oppourtinuty -- is ticket costs. 

For a not-for-profit event, funds from tickets make the event happen (as well as
a handful of generous sponsors to kickstart deposits and the live). The more
money is able to be raised, the more things can be added. 

But ticket costs can be expensive for some. Financial assistance aside, 
having tiers of ticket costs help. 

## Tiers

The following is a general overview of how PyCon AU structured tickets: 

### Speakers: free. 

This has been a controversial topic over the years, with the "Everyone Pays" model
being something PyCon AU did implement in the past, but not any longer. 

Speakers should not have to pay to present. For non-for-profits that often can only
mean free admission, but where possible, paying for accomodation or travel expenses
is ideal. If this is not possible, extending financial assistance to speakers. 

### Students: a token cost.

Every year a significant group of first time attendees for a PyCon AU come from the local
university or tertiary college, where being a full-time student means that the likelihood
of being able to afford a full cost ticket is slim. Where the attendee is able
to show a current Student ID, they can get a ticket for a nominal, token, cost. 

### Enthusiasts: at cost.

Enthusiast attendees are categoried by *not* being employed full time to work in fields associated to the conference. Tickets for this group are calculated to be at-cost: the direct cost of venue, catering, and other expenses based on the estimate amount of attendees. 

### Professionals: padded costs. 

Professional attendees often are not paying for their ticket themselves, as their employer pays for it as part of their education budget. The tickets in this tier are priced at nearly double the Enthusiast cost, but at a cost that an employer wouldn't object to. These costs are normally still exceptionally lower than similar for-profit conferences in the same city. 


### Contributors: micro-sponsorship.

Aimed at individuals who want to be able to financially help the event without being a direct sponsor, these tickets are priced within the "write-off" budget of most small companies (in Australia, $1,000). Professionals with generous companies can often 'get away' with these ticket expenses without higher approval processes, given they are under the 'magic number'. 

Attendees taking up this option are thanked with nominal sponsorship benefits: their logo in digial media options. This doesn't cost the conference, but still thanks them for their support, and means that there is no limit to the amount of Contributor tickets. 


## Further discounts

Some tiers -- namely Enthusiast and Professional -- have either time-based or quantity-based discounts known as "Early Bird". By purchasing early, attendees can often save $100 or more on their ticket cost. In turn, the conference has additional funds to make closer-to-event activities happen. 


##  Inclusions

Based on tier, there are various inclusions. All tickets get full access to the event for all days of talks. All tickets apart from Student tier, get a conference t-shirt (additional shirts can be added for any ticket, including students, at cost). 

As the conference grew larger, additional inclusions such as a ticket to a conference dinner, were removed as these events were removed. The financial and practical obsticles of hosting a 700-person three-course meal in the same venue as presentations were held all day -- or offsite at another conference venue -- meant full-conference dinners were discontinued in favour of 'Self-organised dinners'
