# Sessions

_A conference needs three things: a venue, **speakers**, and attendees._

The speakers a conference hosts is a driving factor in getting people to attend, both people who want to present, and people who want to learn from the presenters. 


## Call for Presentations

The presentations at our event take multiple different forms, a majority of which come from a public call for presentations. We invite speakers from anywhere, regardless of their experience, the oppourunity to put forward a proposal of what they want to present, and we select based on those proposals. 

The software you use for this doesn't have to all that fancy; I've personally used something as simple as a Google Form for some events, but what you ask is important. 

Typically what is submitted in the Call for Presentations is what appears on the conference schedule, and as such there are two audiences: the selection committee, and the conference attendees. 

For both, some information about the potential speaker is need the speaker name<sup>1</sup>, an optional company or affiliation, and a short biography. Optional contact methods such as a social media handle are also useful. 

For the audience: the name of the talk, and the abstract of the talk. Something that is descriptive, but informative, that doesn't keep the audience unaware of what's in-store for the talk. A hook or a problem statement, a possible solution, and the topics the talk will cover is a good start. There are entire theses on what makes a good submission. 

For the selection committee: Why the speaker should speak on the topic. Information that outside of the biography or talk description validate the experience or show why the speaker should speak. Also of extreme usefulness: an outline. Rough or detailed with timing, having a least an outline of the intended talk, no matter if the talk exists yet or not, allows the selection committee to know what the 'spoilers' are, and be able to ensure when it comes to selection time if two talks potentially cover the same ground. 

<sup>1</sup>: the speaker name, not a first/last name, not a given name/surname, just a name. A single field.

### Speaker assistance

Not only is financial assistance useful -- and critical -- to ensure that some speakers are physically able to get to the event, but the encouragement given to potential speakers is also so important. 

The mentorship programme we ran helped with this: offering a list of veteran speakers for potential speakers to contact for reviewing submissions or general questions worked well in our case. This allowed for opt-in based on where a potential speaker thought their session would overlap with a veteran's experience, and never forced only one mentor to handle all inquiries. 

Encouraging new speakers was also something we wanted to do. Even though we had other talk platforms, particularly lightning talks, for speakers to dip their toe, we never rejected a speaker just because they had zero experience. In fact, in submissions we could identify were from new speakers that needed improvement, we reached back out to them with suggestions and tips to improve their submissions.

## Presentation Q&A

We don't have recorded Q&A, as a general rule.

This decision has been dividing, but we have many reasons why we chose this route. 

We've found that when given a floor with the attention of a room, questions -- especially towards speakers of underrepresented minorities -- tend to serve the question asker rather than the speaker. 

For the 2018/2019 years we had three options for speakers: no Q&A, moderated Q&A, and open floor. 

### No Q&A

The "no Q&A" open is specifically "no recorded Q&A", where attendees are invited to ask questions of the speaker after their talk, in the hallway. This serves multiple purposes: 


It prevents one person holding the floor of potentially hundreds of people to seek attention
It allows for the speaker to answer questions without the anxiety of replying of the cuff to a full auditorium. 
It allows for the speaker to get their full allotted talk time (typically 30 minutes), and then move off the stage and out of the room for change over, so the next speaker can setup. 

### Moderated Q&A

The "Moderated Q&A" is the "roaming mic" option, where the session chair (the MC, the person who introduces the speaker) can moderate questions, if required. Typically this form of Q&A is introduced as "Please feel free to ask a question", and any attendee who tries to use the mic as a platform for their opinions is kindly asked to ask a question. 

### Open Floor

"Open floor" is just that: some speakers use their time to have a more general discussion with the attendees, though this option is not often chosen. 

### Session chairs help the speaker succeed

the three options I spoke of were listed options on the session run sheet that we provided for our session chairs -- those who introduce the speaker, time sessions, and generally make sure the room runs well. This checklist also included, for each speaker: 

 * Their name
 * Their session title
 * Their intended start, end, and run time
 * Enough space for notes/adjustments as needed
 * A series of questions to ask:
  * Q&A style
  * how they want to be introduced (job title, fun fact, pronouns, etc)

Each sheet would be for a block of talks, which each chair would be in charge of running. 

We also appended useful tips and information to each sheet: contact information for the organisers, code of conduct contact information, and tips for wording if moderated Q&A was chosen. 

### What I'd improve

One thing I'd like to try out is having a system I've seen at another conference: A Q&A Zone. An area outside of the speaking room setup with a table and stools, where the speaker can take a breather and engage in post-talk discussions with anyone in the audience who choses to ask follow up questions. I'd improve this setup by also having some light refreshments -- even just some water -- because as a speaker just come of stage, I need to recover.
