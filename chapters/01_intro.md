# Introduction

## Why would you run a conference? 

This is the first question I pose to you, dear reader, if you want to put yourself through the rollercoaster of emotion and work -- let alone the regular trilogy of blood, sweat, and years -- and run an actual conference. 

What do you want to get our of your efforts? 

Do you want to start a new event, bringing together ideas and concepts from people within a particular segment of your community? 

Do you want to host a platform for new folk to your vocation to learn and get a jump-start from experts in your field? 

Are you taking temporary custdoianship of an existing space, and clearing the  way for yet another annual pilgramage of your people? 

Or are you doing all of the above? 

## Where I'm coming from.

This book is based on my time volunteering for, then leading, PyCon Australia, the annual Python programming language community conference in Australia, in 2018 and 2019. From a slow escalation of responsibilities to now being able to mentor the next leadership, I hope to encapsulate some of the things my team and I did to host a space that is welcoming to all, some of our misteps, and tricks you could use to make your own event shine. 

## What this isn't. 

Conferences and events, heck community organisation in general, is ever-evolving and extremely subjective. 

This text isn't perscriptive, but merely informational[sp?], based on the implementation of one specific conference. 

Each of the chapters in this book are presented in no particular order, but each are of importance. From ensuring clear communications before and during the event, to momentos after the event; from speaker logistics to attendee care, it's all important.
