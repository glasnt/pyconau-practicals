# Forward

I started writing this book in early January 2020, based on my experiences in 2018 and 2019.

I didn't know what the world would turn into when I started this project. 

All I can hope is that when we are able to see each other again, that this series of words helps kickstart welcoming physical conferences, lest the iterative improvements from many people over many yaers are lost.
