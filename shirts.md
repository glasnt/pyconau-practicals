# Shirts

Attendees like shirts. As an organiser, seeing people choosing to wear your conference shirt months, years after your event is such a delightful sight. 

But shirts can be impractical, ill-fitting, and wasteful. One of the  PyCon AU directors has [opinions](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/337) on this, but sadly doesn't have a recording of this talk. A lot of what I took for shirts covers his original setup, with some (unexpected changes). 


## Design

For years the conference design was based on retellings of Monty Python skits: everything from the basic 'foot', to atomic attack kittens. However, given the community's movement away from the original namesake origin, we asked our redesign artist, Tania Walker, to design us a shirt for our most recent year, which took on our abstract snake ("curly boi") into a full shirt design. 

Regardless of the design, we always followed these guidelines: 

*   Minimal colours: screen printing is expensive the more colours you need. Each colour needs its own screen on which to do the printing, so we try and keep our designs bold in distinct colours, using rasterising if we need to imply shading in a design. 
*   Bold coverage: each shirt is placed large on the centre of the shirt, with a bold black border. This allows us to have more variation when it comes to shirt colours (see next section), plus it means that there are no 'escaped' sections which could be prone to wear and tear. 


## Cuts and colours

Diverse humans need diverse shirts. Conference which use only one cut of shirt mean that not all participants can get a shirt that fits them. Conferences which don't show the dimensions or cut types of shirts mean that not all participants can get a shirt that fits them. 

We mitigate this by having three different cuts of shirt: a straight/box cut ("mens"), a semi-fitted, and a fitted ("women's") cut. In previous years we used Gildan Ultra/Heavy cotton cuts (2000, 2000L, 5000L). However, even with the same manufacturer, the colour variations between cut types mean that not all shirts come in all colours. To mitigate this, we chose a mix of dark colours: maroon, dark green, navy, heather black, chocolate. Between all the cuts we chose, we were able to get at least three of these colours in all the cuts, so in a sea of attendees, you could not at a glance tell any shirt cut from any other cut. Even using a single "unisex" cut this issue can be visibly obvious for the larger sizes, which are often not available in the same array of colours as the smaller sizes (4XL/5XL cuts may only come in navy and black). 

We also choose not to use white or black shirts. White shirts are often semi-transparent, as are lighter colours, when using lighter/thinner fabrics (the Gildan heavy cotton shirts were so nice for comfort and weight). Black shirts are 'boring', and show dust/dandruff in more contrast than other colours. By getting a mix of darker colours we are able to get variation, where eager  attendees can get in early to the shirt table and select their favourite shades. The bold design with the black border ensures the colour of the internal design doesn't matter. 

To make matters worse, the 2000L "Ultra Cotton "Classic Fit" Ladies" shirt was discontinued before the 2018 year. We were able to take the above concepts and with the help of our shirt printer, selecting AS Colour in a [range of cuts](https://2019.pycon-au.org/attend/shirts): Maple, Wafer, and Staple. These shirts aren't as heavy as the Gildan's, but are still great shirts in a range of colours. 


## Ordering

As both an incentive for early ticket purchases and to ensure minimal waste, we close shirt sales 4 weeks before the event, giving tentative numbers to our printer and final numbers 3 weeks before the event. We order 10% more in each size/cut than was ordered to allow for a small amount of swaps. (Yes, this is ~20 different types, but our printer is _amazing_). 

This isn't the most perfect method, but it works for us.
