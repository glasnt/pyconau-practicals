# PyCon AU Practicals

Running a technical conference is not simple. There are many moving parts, many things to consider, and much time required to make an event happen. 

This repository serves as a cache of tips, tricks, suggestions, and considerations that made PyCon AU 2018/2019 the event it was. This cache has been primarily compiled by the conference director, Katie McLaughlin (@glasnt).

### Contributions

Contributions on this repo are subjective: spelling/grammar fixes welcome, but anything else would be considered on the basis of it is something that I missed that happened at PyCon AU 2018/2019. I don't want this cache to extend past that scope.
