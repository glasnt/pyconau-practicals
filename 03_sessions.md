# Sessions

_A conference needs three things: a venue, **speakers**, and attendees._

The speakers a conference hosts is a driving factor in getting people to attend, both people who want to present, and people who want to learn from the presenters.

## Presentation Q&A

We don't have recorded Q&A, as a general rule.

This decision has been dividing, but we have many reasons why we chose this route. 

We've found that when given a floor with the attention of a room, questions -- especially towards speakers of underrepresented minorities -- tend to serve the question asker rather than the speaker. 

For the 2018/2019 years we had three options for speakers: no Q&A, moderated Q&A, and open floor. 

### No Q&A

The "no Q&A" open is specifically "no recorded Q&A", where attendees are invited to ask questions of the speaker after their talk, in the hallway. This serves multiple purposes: 


It prevents one person holding the floor of potentially hundreds of people to seek attention
It allows for the speaker to answer questions without the anxiety of replying of the cuff to a full auditorium. 
It allows for the speaker to get their full allotted talk time (typically 30 minutes), and then move off the stage and out of the room for change over, so the next speaker can setup. 

### Moderated Q&A

The "Moderated Q&A" is the "roaming mic" option, where the session chair (the MC, the person who introduces the speaker) can moderate questions, if required. Typically this form of Q&A is introduced as "Please feel free to ask a question", and any attendee who tries to use the mic as a platform for their opinions is kindly asked to ask a question. 

### Open Floor

"Open floor" is just that: some speakers use their time to have a more general discussion with the attendees, though this option is not often chosen. 

### Session chairs help the speaker succeed

the three options I spoke of were listed options on the session run sheet that we provided for our session chairs -- those who introduce the speaker, time sessions, and generally make sure the room runs well. This checklist also included, for each speaker: 

 * Their name
 * Their session title
 * Their intended start, end, and run time
 * Enough space for notes/adjustments as needed
 * A series of questions to ask:
  * Q&A style
  * how they want to be introduced (job title, fun fact, pronouns, etc)

Each sheet would be for a block of talks, which each chair would be in charge of running. 

We also appended useful tips and information to each sheet: contact information for the organisers, code of conduct contact information, and tips for wording if moderated Q&A was chosen. 

### What I'd improve

One thing I'd like to try out is having a system I've seen at another conference: A Q&A Zone. An area outside of the speaking room setup with a table and stools, where the speaker can take a breather and engage in post-talk discussions with anyone in the audience who choses to ask follow up questions. I'd improve this setup by also having some light refreshments -- even just some water -- because as a speaker just come of stage, I need to recover.
