# Thanks

No conference can be run by any one person. There are many thanks for the efforts that made PyCon AU possible. 

The full list of thanks for [2018](https://2018.pycon-au.org/news/pyconau-2018-over/) and [2019](https://2019.pycon-au.org/news/pycon-au-over/) include an item of "everyone else that weâ€™ve missed", because it's indeed possible to miss someone, and no-one who helped shouldn't be thanked. 

As for this particular collection of words, some special thanks: 

* all those that have bugged me to release this compendium.
