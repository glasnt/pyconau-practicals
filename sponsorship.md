# Sponsorship

Conferences are not cheap. If you want to offer a venue with catering, AV recording, financial assistance, and other inclusive properties without having excruciatingly expensive ticket prices, you need to have financial offsets from sponsors. 

How your conference works with sponsors is extraordinarily subjective, and limited to what your community will accept. 

For 2018/2019, we did not do booths, and we did not do conference swag bags. This had benefits and issues. 

Without vendor booths, sponsors don't have an anchor point to engage with the attendees, and must find other ways to do any recruitment or outreach opportunities. We do have a communal jobs board which we let sponsors and attendees know they can use to share "looking for work" and "looking to hire" opportunities. Without booths and swag bags, we have less waste, and we do offer a communal sticker table for all attendees to add and take from. (Pro tip: ensure this table is labelled and event staff are made aware that this table is not to be cleared at the end of service). 

Whatever your limitations, communication is paramount. The cycles of corporate sponsorship are long and slow, so the biggest single suggestion I can give is that as soon as you announce your conference dates, launch your sponsorship prospectus. This may seem like an awkward order of operations, but the conversations within companies negotiating community sponsorship are long, and the more time you give potential financial investors, the more success you'll have.
