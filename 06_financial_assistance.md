# Financial Assistance 

_A conference needs three things: a venue, speakers, and **attendees**._

Getting to a conference requires dedicated time and funds, and is out of reach for many people. 

This is why we've run an annual financial assistance program to help get as many people as possible to our conference. The name has changed over the years -- fin aid, assistance -- but the system is the same -- direct financial assistance to get people to our event. 

Our budget contains a line item of a certain budget set aside for financial aid. We try and use these funds to get as many people to our event as we can. 

When our call for proposals opens, we also open our [Assistance](https://2018.pycon-au.org/assistance/) scheme. We invite anyone to apply via an online form, which asks the following questions:

*   What is your name?
    *   We use a single field for this for a reason
*   What is your email address?
    *   Additionally asking that this be the same as the email they used for the call for proposals
*   What parts of the event do you plan to attend? 
    *   This helps for those planning to only attend certain parts
*   What financial assistance do you need?
    *   Not everyone needs just a flight and a bed. Sometimes people need to organise alternative child minding, or need visas and funds can help with those.
*   What do you want to get out of PyCon AU
    *   This is the "application statement". We want to try and get our money to get as many people to our event as possible, but we also highly encourage teachers, students, and educators to attend. Sharing their experiences with others helps more people learn. We also ask people to list if they've submitted to speak.
*   Total money requested
    *   A flat amount, in the local currency. We've found that asking for separation between flights and accommodation isn't as accurate as it could be, owing to factors like flights being more expensive the closer to the event, etc. 
*   Do you identify as a member of an underrepresented group?
    *   This is a checkbox. 
*   Have you received financial aid to attend a past event?

All successful applications get a free ticket, which we budget as an "at cost" ticket; we still need to budget for any 'free' tickets given this way. 

Applications are then considered by a group of people, comprising of members of the core organising group, as well as community members. The selection methods change year on year, but in general reviewers are asked to rate applications based on their application statement, ignoring the value asked for. A second round then accounts for amount of money asks, and balances such elements as expensive travel vs just asking for free tickets. For example, the funds to get one person that has to fly internationally could get five local students who need tickets plus bus fare. 

---

This entire process is extremely subjective, and we always receive more applications than we can cover. Some years weigh more towards helping speakers attend, some towards more free tickets. Often a list of submissions with 'spam' content removed is ordered by total price, and we accept anyone up until the cut-off at our maximum budget. 

_On spam:_ It's not uncommon for us to receive spam submissions. Given we have a limited amount of budget to use, we use a general 'gut feel' to any application that we think is not made in good faith. 

Once we have our list, we email out to submitters and get them to confirm receipt and acceptance of the assistance. We then tell them of our claim process, as we offer reimbursements for invoices, and cannot give out cash. The laws for income vary from country to country, so your mileage may vary. 

Also keep in mind that reimbursements don't help those who cannot front the funds to pay for a weekend's accommodation in the first place. We have in the past offered to pay for a hotel directly, which has helped. This process doesn't scale, as it creates overheads for the organisers, but it can help in rare cases. 

We also don't allocate more than we can spend. If everyone accepts the assistance and claims the total amount, we want to ensure we can cover all our obligations.
